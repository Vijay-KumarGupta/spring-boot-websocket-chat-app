# Summary :
A Spring Boot Chat Application is a real-time messaging app built using Spring Boot, a Java framework. It allows users to send and receive messages instantly and securely. Here's a simple breakdown of how it works:

Backend:

Spring Boot manages the server-side logic, such as handling user requests and storing messages.
Real-Time Messaging:

Uses WebSockets to enable instant communication between users.
Database:

Stores user information, chat messages, and chat history.
Security:

Protects user accounts with login systems (like usernames and passwords) and encrypts messages for privacy.
Features:

One-on-one and group chats.
Notifications for new messages.
Persistent message storage.
Frontend:

A user-friendly interface (like a web or mobile app) that shows chat rooms, messages, and notifications.
